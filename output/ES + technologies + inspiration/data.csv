4,"Shifting to healthier cities with improved urban ecological infrastructure: From the perspectives of planning, implementation, governance and engineering",Li et al.,2017,yes,
5,Building the layers of a new manufacturing taxonomy: How 3D printing is creating a new landscape of production eco-systems and competitive dynamics,Kapetaniou et al.,2018,yes,"the abstract suggests that the research paper explores the impact of 3d printing technologies on manufacturing ecosystems across different industries and contexts. it draws on existing literature to develop a new taxonomy that explains the areas of impact of 3d printing and emphasizes the role of users in co-creation and personalization. the paper also applies a competitive dynamics model to analyze how 3d printing influences competition within different industry sectors. this approach aligns with the objectives of biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research, which often involves examining how advancements in technology can transform existing ecosystems and service delivery models. the focus on understanding the broader implications of 3d printing, including its role in competitive dynamics and user engagement, makes this article potentially valuable for those interested in how biotechnological innovations can be integrated into or replace existing ecosystem services."
7,An ecosystem services perspective for classifying and valuing the environmental impacts of geothermal power projects,Cook et al.,2017,yes,"the abstract presents a thorough thematic review of the ecosystem service impacts related to geothermal power projects, aligning well with biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research. it discusses the classification and valuation methods for ecosystem services, emphasizing both monetary and non-monetary approaches. the focus on non-market valuation techniques and the critical assessment of existing environmental impact assessments adds valuable insights for understanding the ecological implications of renewable energy technologies, which can inform biotechnological approaches to ecosystem service replacement."
10,Nature-inspired innovation policy: Biomimicry as a pathway to leverage biodiversity for economic development,Lebdioui et al.,2022,yes,"the abstract emphasizes the importance of biomimicry as a means of leveraging biodiversity for sustainable economic development, particularly in developing nations. it highlights the potential for nature-inspired innovation to inform industrial practices while addressing the underutilization of biodiversity in these contexts. the discussion on policy landscapes and coordination failures indicates a clear connection to biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research. the paperâ€™s focus on integrating environmental insights into economic strategies aligns well with the goals of promoting sustainable practices and enhancing ecosystem services."
11,Grand challenges in entomology: Priorities for action in the coming decades,Luke et al.,2023,yes,"the abstract suggests that the research paper focuses on the importance of entomology in understanding and managing terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, as well as its potential benefits to humanity. it outlines a process for identifying high priority challenges in entomology, which could include areas for improving agricultural practices, managing vector-borne diseases, and inspiring technological advances. the paper's focus on ecosystem services and the potential for entomology to contribute to addressing global challenges related to human health and environmental change indicates that it could be suitable for biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research. the inclusion of themes such as ""ecosystem benefits,"" ""technology and resources,"" and ""anthropogenic impacts and conservation"" suggests that the research may explore how entomology can be used to replace or enhance ecosystem services, which is a relevant topic for biotechnological research."
3,Digital Twin for Intelligent Context-Aware IoT Healthcare Systems,Elayan et al.,2021,no,"the abstract primarily focuses on the advancements in digital healthcare through the implementation of digital twin technology and machine learning for heart disease diagnosis. it does not address biotechnological ecosystem services or topics related to ecological replacements or environmental impacts, which are central to the area of ecosystem service replacement research."
