1,Mapping Urban Park Cultural Ecosystem Services: A Comparison of Twitter and Semi-Structured Interview Methods,Johnson et al.,2019,yes,"the abstract describes a research study that aims to understand the benefits received from urban greenspaces, specifically focusing on parks like prospect park in brooklyn, new york. the research employs a novel approach by utilizing crowdsourced data from social media, specifically tweets on twitter, to measure and evaluate the social values associated with parks. this method is compared with traditional semi-structured interview protocols to assess the effectiveness and limitations of social media data in capturing the benefits of urban greenspaces. the study employs the millennium ecosystem assessment's (mea) cultural ecosystem services (ces) framework to analyze the data, which includes a wide range of benefits such as recreation, social relations, and spiritual values. the findings suggest that while all three methods elicit overlapping sets of ces, the twitter dataset is more comprehensive in capturing all 10 mea-defined ces. additionally, only the directed question interview protocol effectively elicits spiritual values. the study concludes with a discussion on the trade-offs and triangulation opportunities of using twitter data to measure ces and other urban park benefits. this research aligns with biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research as it focuses on understanding and quantifying the ecosystem services provided by urban greenspaces, which can be crucial for planning and decision-making in urban environments. the use of novel methods, such as social media data, to assess these services is also relevant to biotechnological approaches, which often involve the use of technology and data analysis to understand and enhance ecosystem functions."
5,"Communities and blue carbon: the role of traditional management systems in providing benefits for carbon storage, biodiversity conservation and livelihoods",Vierros et al.,2017,yes,"the abstract discusses the importance of blue carbon ecosystems not only for carbon sequestration but also for their broader ecosystem services, which include supporting biodiversity, fisheries, and cultural practices. it highlights the potential for collaboration between different sectors and the incorporation of traditional knowledge, making it relevant for research focused on the replacement and management of ecosystem services within a biotechnological context. the mention of local management initiatives suggests practical applications that could be explored further in relation to biotechnology in ecosystem service replacement."
8,"Using Crowdsourced Big Data to Unravel Urban Green Space Utilization during COVID-19 in Guangzhou, China",Liu et al.,2022,yes,"the abstract describes a study that focuses on the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the utilization of urban green spaces (ugss) in guangzhou, china. it involves collecting data through a web crawler program and analyzing sentiment towards these spaces. the research seems to cover a wide range of topics relevant to biotechnological ecosystem service replacement, including the role of ugss in meeting spiritual and cultural needs, the effect of the pandemic on their use, and the factors influencing the choice of specific ugss. this could be suitable for research in biotechnological ecosystem service replacement, as it touches on the importance of green spaces in human well-being and the potential for biotechnology to enhance or replace these services if green spaces are underutilized or damaged. the study also touches on the emotional aspects of ugs use, which could be relevant for designing biotechnological solutions that cater to human emotional and spiritual needs."
11,The Quantitative Assessment of the Ecological Assets in the Center Region of Chengdu City Based on Remote Sensing and GIS Technology,Feng et al.,2019,yes,"the abstract discusses the use of remote sensing and gis technology to quantitatively assess ecological assets in an urban context, focusing on various ecosystem services and their values over time. this quantitative evaluation model, which incorporates ecological economics and addresses land use changes, is relevant to research on biotechnological ecosystem service replacement. the findings aim to inform sustainable urban development and natural resource management, aligning well with the goals of studying and enhancing ecosystem service replacement through biotechnological approaches."
16,Lake Superior Manoomin cultural and ecosystem characterization study,Hosterman et al.,2023,yes,"the abstract discusses the significance of manoomin (wild rice) to the anishinaabeg culture and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and biodiversity. it also details a collaborative study aimed at understanding the cultural and ecological importance of manoomin habitats, which is relevant to biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research. the study's focus on habitat restoration and the use of specific metrics aligns with the goals of preserving and enhancing ecosystem services through biotechnological approaches. overall, the paper appears to be applicable to research in this area."
18,"Northern Wild Rice (Zizania palustris L.) breeding, genetics, and conservation",McGilp et al.,2023,yes,"the abstract discusses the domestication of northern wild rice (nwr), its challenges in breeding efforts, and the potential for utilizing comparative genomic approaches to identify genes conferring agronomic traits of interest. it also mentions the importance of preserving natural stands of nwr for ecosystem, nutritional, spiritual, and economic services. these points align with the goal of researching ecosystem service replacement, as they highlight the ecological, cultural, and agricultural significance of nwr and the need for conservation efforts. the mention of genomic resources and the potential for utilizing comparative genomics to identify domestication traits further suggests the potential for biotechnological interventions in enhancing the species' ecosystem services."
4,When peer-reviewed publications are not enough! Delivering science for natural resource management,McKinley et al.,2012,maybe,"the abstract discusses the evolution of natural resource management, focusing on the integration of social and cultural values alongside traditional resource extraction. while it highlights the importance of citizen science and participatory research in enhancing science delivery for resource managers, it does not specifically address biotechnological ecosystem service replacement. the concepts outlined may be applicable, but the primary focus appears to be on management practices and public engagement rather than biotechnological innovations aimed at ecosystem service replenishment."
9,Changing agricultural land use: evaluating the benefits and trade-offs,Wallace et al.,2016,maybe,
14,From the Perspective of Ecosystem to Discuss the Critical Factors in the Elderly Social Support,Qian et al.,2019,no,"the abstract provided discusses a study on the distribution of questionnaire responses among the elderly in shanghai regarding the importance of various forms of social support. it does not directly address the replacement of ecosystem services with biotechnological solutions. while the study touches upon the challenges of an aging population and the importance of social support for elderly individuals, it does not delve into the application of biotechnological methods to address these challenges or to replace ecosystem services in a biotechnological context. therefore, it is not directly suitable for biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research."
15,Present and future are getting confused: are we equipped to face the technological revolution?,Perilongo et al.,2023,no,"the abstract focuses on the role of technology in science, the challenges faced by future generations of scientists, and the need for educational reform within academic institutions. it does not specifically address biotechnological ecosystem service replacement or any related ecological or environmental issues. therefore, it is not suitable for research in that particular area."
