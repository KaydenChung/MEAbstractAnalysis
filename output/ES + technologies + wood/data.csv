68,Model-based evaluation of impact of soil redistribution on soil organic carbon stocks in a temperate hedgerow landscape,Lacoste et al.,2016,yes.,"the abstract describes a research paper that focuses on the use of a spatially explicit model to study soil organic carbon (soc) dynamics in an agroforestry system, particularly in a temperate hedgerow landscape dedicated to dairy farming. the investigation involves quantifying the impact of soil redistribution due to tillage and water processes on soc storage at the landscape scale. since the study relates to ecosystem services, specifically soil protection and carbon sequestration, which are relevant to biotechnological approaches for ecosystem service replacement, the article is deemed suitable for that research domain. the analysis highlights the application of advanced modeling techniques to understand the interactions of land use, climate, and soil management practices on ecosystem function."
69,Levers for alleviating poverty in forests,Hajjar et al.,2021,maybe  ,"the abstract focuses primarily on forest management strategies and their effectiveness in alleviating poverty, with only a limited mention of ecosystem services through mechanisms like payments for ecosystem services (pes). while it discusses important policies and practices that can intersect with biotechnological approaches (e.g., agroforestry), the main emphasis is on poverty alleviation rather than directly on biotechnological ecosystem service replacement. therefore, the relevance to biotechnological replacement research is not direct, but potential connections exist through strategies that might incorporate biotechnological solutions within the broader context of service replacement."
