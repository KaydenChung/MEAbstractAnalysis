Efficient Water Use in Residential Urban Landscapes,Hilaire,2008,"In the United States, urban population growth, improved living standards, limited development of new water supplies, and dwindling current water supplies are causing the demand for treated municipal water to exceed the supply. Although water used to irrigate the residential urban landscape will vary according to factors such as landscape type, management practices, and region, landscape irrigation can vary from 40% to 70% of household use of water. So, the efficient use of irrigation water in urban landscapes must be the primary focus of water conservation. In addition, plants in a typical residential landscape often are given more water than is required to maintain ecosystem services such as carbon regulation, climate control, and preservation of aesthetic appearance. This implies that improvements in the efficiency of landscape irrigation will yield significant water savings. Urban areas across the United States face different water supply and demand issues and a range of factors will affect how water is used in the urban landscape. The purpose of this review is to summarize how irrigation and water application technologies; landscape design and management strategies; the relationship among people, plants, and the urban landscape; the reuse of water resources; economic and noneconomic incentives; and policy and ordinances impact the efficient use of water in the urban landscape."
Sustainable energy potential from biomass through ecosystem services trade-off analysis: The case of the Province of Rovigo (Northern Italy),Gissi,2016,"Bioenergy production is an important Ecosystem Service (ES) provided by natural and semi-natural ecosystems, which can concur to reach EU targets of 20% of total energy production from renewable sources. Environmental concerns with respect to bioenergy are multiple. Certification Schemes, aimed at reducing the negative effects of biomass energy supply chains, are not effective in controlling possible cumulative effects at regional level caused by both macro and micro feedstock producers and users. Sustainable feedstock production is often underestimated in energy planning and in the issuing of plant permits. This study applies an ES-based approach in order to quantify and map bioenergy sustainable potential in the Province of Rovigo (Region of Veneto, Italy), an intensively farmed agro-environment, and translate bioenergy environmental impacts in terms of ES trade-offs. The results show that the share of bioenergy potential from trade-offs with other ESs is limited. The magnitude and variability of ESs trade-offs are analyzed and discussed, resulting in a spatial distribution which is place-based and context dependent. Management solutions should be considered in order to mitigate trade-offs with other ESs, increasing ecological and social acceptability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Familiarity breeds content: assessing bird species popularity with culturomics,Correia,2016,"Understanding public perceptions of biodiversity is essential to ensure continued support for conservation efforts. Despite this, insights remain scarce at broader spatial scales, mostly due to a lack of adequate methods for their assessment. The emergence of new technologies with global reach and high levels of participation provide exciting new opportunities to study the public visibility of biodiversity and the factors that drive it. Here, we use a measure of internet saliency to assess the national and international visibility of species within four taxa of Brazilian birds (toucans, hummingbirds, parrots and woodpeckers), and evaluate how much of this visibility can be explained by factors associated with familiarity, aesthetic appeal and conservation interest. Our results strongly indicate that familiarity (human population within the range of a species) is the most important factor driving internet saliency within Brazil, while aesthetic appeal (body size) best explains variation in international saliency. Endemism and conservation status of a species had small, but often negative, effects on either metric of internet saliency. While further studies are needed to evaluate the relationship between internet content and the cultural visibility of different species, our results strongly indicate that internet saliency can be considered as a broad proxy of cultural interest."
Interactive spatial planning of urban green infrastructure - Retrofitting green roofs where ecosystem services are most needed in Oslo,Venter,2021,"Spatial multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is increasingly being used to inform urban green infrastructure planning. We explore the use of modern cloud computing technologies (Google Earth Engine) to facilitate public access to spatial MCDA of ecosystem services from green infrastructure. Using the spatial prioritization of green roof retrofitting in Oslo, Norway, as a case study, we present a web application that is a generalizable tool for engaging stakeholders in spatial planning of ecosystem restoration and nature-based solutions. In our application, green roof designers, owners and operators identified the relative importance of a suite of potential ecosystem services (ES) gained from retrofitting of green roofs, conditional on preference profiles expected by users of different building functional types. The ES assessed included temperature regulation, stormwater runoff mitigation, habitat for biodiversity, aesthetic value, and noise reduction. In Oslo we found high spatial correlation in ES deficits, implying that even large differences in stakeholder preferences for individual ES will lead MCDA to identify common interests in the spatial targeting of green roofs. Nevertheless, we found the interactive spatial MCDA web application to have potential for improving planning process efficiency in engaging stakeholders. In more heterogenous urban landscapes, with lower spatial correlation of individual ES, spatial MCDA also has scope to improve the output efficiency of spatial targeting of nature-based solutions such as green roofs.

"Bird Killer, Industrial Intruder or Clean Energy? Perceiving Risks to Ecosystem Services Due to an Offshore Wind Farm",Klain,2018,"Proposals to develop renewable energy technologies may threaten local values, which can generate opposition. Efforts to explain this opposition have focused on perceived negative aesthetic and environmental impact. Less attention has been paid to a fuller suite of the perceived risks and benefits associated with new energy technologies. This paper thus investigates impacts of an offshore wind farm pertaining to individual perceptions and judgments, and why risks to some ecosystem services might be cause for greater public concern than others. We find that this difference can be attributed to the affective and intuitive ways in which people perceive risk. Our mixed-methods design used interviews (n = 27) that involved risk-benefit weighting tasks and an animated visualization to help people imagine an offshore wind farm in a familiar place. We found that affectively-loaded impacts (harm to charismatic wildlife and visual intrusion) were assigned greater weight than more easily quantifiable impacts (displacement of fishing, impact to tourism, cost of compliance with regulations). Interviewees identified increased regional energy self-sufficiency as the most valued potential benefit of an offshore wind farm. These results have implications for ecosystem service assessments generally and, more specifically, for our understanding of 'affective' dimensions of development proposals. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Harnessing artificial intelligence technology and social media data to support Cultural Ecosystem Service assessments,Vigl,2021,"Cultural Ecosystem Services (CESs), such as aesthetic and recreational enjoyment, as well as sense of place and cultural heritage, play an outstanding role in the contribution of landscapes to human well-being.Scientists, however, still often struggle to understand how landscape characteristics contribute to deliver these intangible benefits, largely because it is hard to navigate how people value nature, and because there is a lack in methods that accommodate both comprehensive and time-efficient evaluations.Recent advances in technology and the proliferation of new data sources, such as social media data, open promising alternatives to traditional, resource-intensive methods, facilitating the understanding of the multiple relationships between people and nature.Here, we examine a user-friendly artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach for inferring visual-sensory landscape values from Flickr data, combining computer vision with text mining. We show it is possible to automatically relate photographers' preferences in capturing landscape elements to a set of CESs (aesthetic value, outdoor recreation, cultural heritage, symbolic species) with reasonable accuracy, using the semantic content provided by approximately 640,000 artificially generated tags of photographs taken in the UNESCO world heritage site 'The Dolomites' (Italy). We used the geographic information in the data to demonstrate that these preferences can be further linked to different natural and human variables and be used to spatially predict CES patterns.Over 90% of photograph tags could be linked to four CES categories with reasonable confidence (accuracy ration similar to 80%). The Dolomites are highly appreciated for its aesthetic value (66% of images classified to that category) and vast cultural heritage (13%), followed by its outdoor recreation opportunities (11%) and symbolic species (10%). CES benefiting hotspots were found in areas with high tourism development and close to residential areas, and could largely be explained by a combination of environmental (e.g. landscape composition) and infrastructural (e.g. accessibility) variables.We conclude that online available AI technology and social media data can effectively be used to support rapid, flexible and transferrable CES assessments. Our work can provide a reference for innovative adaptive management approaches that can harness emerging technologies to gain insights into human-nature relationships and to sustainably manage our environment.A free Plain Language Summary can be found within the Supporting Information of this article."
"Reading Ecosystem Services at the Local Scale through a Territorial Approach: the Case of Peri-Urban Agriculture in the Thau Lagoon, Southern France",Ruoso,2015,"In recent years, the ecosystem services (ES) concept has become a major paradigm for natural resource management. While policy-makers demand hard monetary evidence that nature conservation would be worth investing in, ongoing attempts are being made to formalize the concept as a scientifically robust one size fits all analytical framework. These attempts have highlighted several major limitations of the ES concept. First, to date, the concept has paid little attention to the role of humans in the production of ES. Second, the ongoing formalization of the ES concept is turning it into a technology of globalization, thereby increasingly ignoring the socio-cultural context and history within which ecosystems emerge. Third, economic valuation has been shown to limit local stakeholders in expressing their daily and immediate ways of interacting with their environment over and beyond extrinsic motivation provided by financial gains. We address these three limitations by analyzing a social evaluation of the roles of peri-urban farmland from a territorial perspective. Our case study is the Thau lagoon in southern France. We conducted in-depth interviews with a broad range of stakeholders and ran two participatory workshops. Using a territorial meta-model that distinguishes three levels-physical, logical, and existential-stakeholder data were analyzed to unravel the interplay of territorial elements at these three levels that gives rise to ES in two broad categories: food production and aesthetic landscape. The coupling of ES and territory concepts opens up several novel analytical perspectives. It allows partitioning of ES in a manner that re-contextualizes them and gives insight about both their physical constituents and their meaning at the territorial level. Additional research should incorporate the dynamics of service demand and supply, and further investigate options for implementation."
Room at the margins for energy-crops? A qualitative analysis of stakeholder views on the use of marginal land for biomass production in Denmark,Shortall,2019,"Greater production of agricultural biomass for energy generation means a greater overlap between the energy and agricultural value chains. The production of biofuels from food crops was previously criticised as conflicting with food production. Use of so-called 'marginal land' is proposed to overcome previous controversies.Using interviews and document analysis, this paper explores the meaning of 'marginal land' for non-food energy crop production in Denmark and conflicts that arose over its proposed use. In Denmark there was a different conception of marginal land - environmentally sensitive land where intensive cultivation causes impacts. Policies were put in place to promote the use of this 'environmentally marginal land'. However, competing environmental objectives for this land - for different types of biodiversity, ecosystems services and aesthetic preferences meant these policies were repealed.The paper shows how discussions of biomass production on agricultural land, and particularly marginal land, reflect the nuances of competing land uses in agriculturally intensive countries like Denmark. It is not only a matter of trade-offs between different types of agricultural production, such as food and fuel, or between environmental benefits and production, but over the optimal environmental use of the land to achieve multifunctional benefits. As well as questions of equity, access and practicality, the marginal land debate in agriculturally intensive countries needs to include questions of appropriate and desired environmental outcomes and means of stakeholder engagement to establish these."
Reclamation of urban brownfields through phytoremediation: Implications for building sustainable and resilient towns,Nissim,2021,"Adverse environmental effects related to unsustainable development are compelling people to welcome recent advances in technology that rely on principles of sustainability. The regeneration of contaminated brownfields has immense developmental potential that includes economic, social and environmental benefits, while reducing pressure on surrounding greenfield areas. Phytoremediation is a green technology that is highly suitable for most brownfield sites where pollution is moderate and environmental contaminants are dispersed over large surface areas. The current review centers on a description of phytoremediation, especially using woody plants, as an active component of the urban landscape. An overview of the additional environmental (i.e., beyond soil cleansing) and social benefits associated with this technology is provided, including the technical constraints and knowledge gaps that should be further addressed to make this technique efficient on a larger scale. The use of trees for the reclamation of brownfields shows several benefits in addition to depollution. Most tree species used for phytoremediation may actively reduce the volume of stormwater runoff and mitigate the risk of local flooding events. They can actively contribute to CO2 sequestration and function as highly aesthetic living barriers for noise and air pollution (PM) attenuation. Some uncertainties associated with the use of this reclamation technique in urban areas (i.e., BVOC emission, pollen production) still need to be addressed. Nevertheless, within the large family of green technologies, phytoremediation has huge potential to be used as an effective tool for the cleanup of contaminated urban brownfields, thus contributing to the development of more sustainable modern towns."
Phytoremediation by ornamental plants: a beautiful and ecological alternative,Rocha,2022,"Phytoremediation is an eco-friendly and economical technology in which plants are used for the removal of contaminants presents in the urban and rural environment. One of the challenges of the technique is the proper destination of the biomass of plants. In this context, the use of ornamental plants in areas under contamination treatment improves landscape, serving as a tourist option and source of income with high added value. In addition to their high stress tolerance, rapid growth, high biomass production, and good root development, ornamental species are not intended for animal and human food consumption, avoiding the introduction of contaminants into the food web in addition to improving the environments with aesthetic value. Furthermore, ornamental plants provide multiple ecosystem services, and promote human well-being, while contributing to the conservation of biodiversity. In this review, we summarized the main uses of ornamental plants in phytoremediation of contaminated soil, air, and water. We discuss the potential use of ornamental plants in constructed buffer strips aiming to mitigate the contamination of agricultural lands occurring in the vicinity of sources of contaminants. Moreover, we underlie the ecological and health benefits of the use of ornamental plants in urban and rural landscape projects. This study is expected to draw attention to a promising decontamination technology combined with the beautification of urban and rural areas as well as a possible alternative source of income and diversification in horticultural production."
Terrestrial ecosystem monitoring in Canada and the greater role for integrated earth observation,Pasher,2014,"Ecosystems are valuable as well as aesthetic. The natural functions of ecosystems can have profound effects on the economy, and human and wildlife health. The aggregate value of these ecosystem services may far exceed the economic value derived from resource extraction or industrial development, especially when considering the costs of restoring ecosystems. There is increasing interest, therefore, in monitoring and protecting ecosystems, and accounting for the biodiversity and services they provide. In 2010, Canada undertook a review of ecosystem status and trends that identified the regions and ecosystems where management is most urgently needed. The authors concluded that more large-scale, long-term, standardized, and spatially complete information is needed for effective monitoring and management. Satellite-based earth observation (EO) tools were seen as ameans of addressing this information need. In a separate exercise, a list of priority questions for conservation policy and management at a national level was produced: the resolution of three-quarters of those questions appears to depend on EO tools to a significant or critical extent. Canada has a long and successful history in all aspects of earth observation, placing it amongst the leaders in the international remote sensing community. Whereas the need for measuring ecosystem services to humans and wildlife is increasingly important, the challenges for doing so are increasingly significant and the technology required is increasingly complex. Overcoming these challenges is necessary to address emerging conservation priorities including measurement of ecosystem attributes to support habitat conservation for Species at Risk, measuring functional capacity of ecosystems to mitigate effects of climate change, monitoring and mitigating effects of resource extraction, and supporting industrial development in Canada's north. Addressing emerging priorities requires dialogue among ecologists and decision makers, coordinated at regional and national scales, and requires drawing on the best EO technologies and infrastructure available. This review highlights the urgency of a coordinated approach for innovative applications of EO tools toward conservation and discusses some of the key elements that might be included and opportunities and challenges that might be encountered, by such an approach."
Impacts of groundwater and climate variability on terrestrial groundwater dependent ecosystems: a review of geospatial assessment approaches and challenges and possible future research directions,Chiloane,2022,"Terrestrial groundwater dependent vegetation (TGDV) are crucial ecosystems which provide important goods and services such as carbon sequestration, habitat, water purification and aesthetic benefits in semi-arid environments. Global climate change and anthropogenic impacts on surface water resources have led to increased competing claims on groundwater resources to meet an exponential water demand for environmental needs, agricultural and developmental needs. This has led to the unsustainable exploitation of groundwater resources, resulting in groundwater table declines, threatening the sustainability of TGDV. It is on this premise that the review aims to provide a detailed overview on the progress in remote sensing of TGDV. More specifically, the paper provides a background on TGDV and threats, and then further explores recent knowledge on vegetation response to groundwater variability and climate change impacts on TGDV. This review also focuses on recent progress in remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) based techniques for mapping and monitoring of TGDV and explores the available satellite products and delineation techniques. Finally, the challenges of remote sensing and future research direction are explored. To date, research on TGDV has gained considerable interest with the year 2020 resulting in the most scientific journal publications. Of significant importance is an increase in studies integrating field measurements, model-based techniques with remotely sensed estimates. Despite this progress, only 0.06% of groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDE) research has utilized remote sensing techniques in the past 20 years, with the top three publishing countries namely, Australia, USA, and China. The literature reveals that TDGV are highly heterogenous, complex ecosystems with unique responses to varying groundwater levels. The vegetation responses differ with the landscape, vegetation type, and seasonality at specific groundwater table thresholds. Despite significant progress in TGDV scientific research, further remote sensing studies are required to understand the annual and inter-annual vegetation response to groundwater variability at local scales. Further, climate impacts are difficult to discriminate from other influences such as disturbances, management, and anthropogenic activities. Moreover, new generation remote sensing products integrated with machine learning techniques have the potential to improve TGDV delineation. Despite these challenges, the development of cloud computing technologies such as google earth engine (GEE) and artificial intelligence (AI) provide advanced computer-processing capabilities for long-term monitoring and integration of multi-source datasets required to capture the effects of climate and groundwater variability on TGDV."
Land-use change from food to energy: meta-analysis unravels effects of bioenergy on biodiversity and cultural ecosystem services,Donnison,2021,"Bioenergy has been identified as a key contributor to future energy scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement targets, and is relied upon in scenarios both with and without bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, owing to the multiple ways in which bioenergy can substitute fossil fuels. Understanding the environmental and societal impacts of land-use change (LUC) to bioenergy crops is important in determining where and how they could be deployed, and the resulting trade-offs and co-benefits. We use systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the existing literature on two poorly understood impacts of this LUC that are likely to have an important effect on public acceptability: cultural ecosystem services and biodiversity. We focus on the impact of LUC to non-food bioenergy crops on agricultural landscapes, where large-scale bioenergy planting may be required. Our meta-analysis finds strong benefits for biodiversity overall (up 75% +/- 13%), with particular benefits for bird abundance (+81% +/- 32%), bird species richness (+100% +/- 31%), arthropod abundance (+52% +/- 36%), microbial biomass (+77% +/- 24%), and plant species richness (+25% +/- 22%), when land moves out of either arable crops or grassland to bioenergy production. Conversions from arable land to energy trees led to particularly strong benefits, providing an insight into how future LUC to non-food bioenergy crops could support biodiversity. There were inadequate data to complete a meta-analysis on the effects of non-food bioenergy crops on cultural ecosystem services, and few generalizable conclusions from a systematic review of the literature, however, findings highlight the importance of landscape context and planting strategies in determining impact. Our findings demonstrate improved farm-scale biodiversity on agricultural land with non-food bioenergy crops, but also limited knowledge concerning public response to this LUC, which could prove crucial to the successful expansion of bioenergy to meet the Paris targets."
What does the UK public want farmland to look like?,Rust,2021,"As populations grow and demand for food rises, major shifts in global agri-food policy are likely to significantly impact agricultural land use. As the UK has now separated from the Common Agricultural Policy as it left the EU, Brexit offers a unique opportunity to create UK-specific agricultural policies that may dramatically shape both the countryside?s appearance and the ecosystem services it provides. However, it is important to understand how the public ? as taxpayers of agri-environment schemes ? want the farmed countryside to look. To fill this knowledge gap, we undertook a novel mixed-methods study using a survey and collage-making workshops to understand aesthetic preferences for perceived ?ideal? and ?environmentally friendly? farm landscapes. Multinomial regression of data from a nationally representative survey of 2050 respondents demonstrated widespread support for agricultural landscapes containing trees and free-ranging livestock for ideal UK farm landscapes. Aesthetic preferences differed based on several socio-demographic variables, including gender, income and education. Landscapes with renewable energy technology, trees, and no livestock were perceived to be the most ?environmentally friendly? farms, though wind turbines were visually unappealing. Eighty participants created collages of their ideal and environmentally friendly farming landscapes and completed a short survey to explain their choices. Qualitative thematic analysis of the collages and explanatory text found a desire for mosaic ideal farm landscapes focused either on agricultural or wild biological diversity. Results for the environmentally friendly farms reflected those in the survey. We discuss how our findings relate to implications for post-Brexit agricultural policy formation, particularly with regards to integrating public preferences around agri-food systems, to ensure tax-payers? views are considered."
Changing agricultural land use: evaluating the benefits and trade-offs,Wallace,2016,"Changing the mix of land uses in agricultural systems affects the benefits enjoyed by humans. Such benefits range from food and water to aesthetic and spiritual benefits. If one aim of land-use decision-making is to maintain or improve the quality of human lives, the consequences of proposed changes must be evaluated across all benefits that contribute to human well-being. This is a challenging task. Difficulties include classifying benefits to minimise double-counting, objective quantification of disparate benefits, and the costs of analyses. The reported work addresses these issues by testing a new classification of benefits and using expert elicitation to reduce assessment costs. Compared to current agricultural systems, the impacts of the two perennial plant technologies assessed were generally either neutral or positive with respect to the flow of benefits. At low cost, the benefits analysis informs stakeholders of the impacts of proposed land-use changes and the breadth of issues that need to be considered by decision-makers."
"Urban trees in university campus: structure, function, and ecological values",Wang,2021,"University campuses usually have more trees and can provide various ecosystem services. However, there are few reports on tree ecosystem services of Chinese university campuses, especially in northern China. This study investigated the trees in the campus of Shenyang Institute of Technology and analyzed its ecological benefits and monetary value through i-Tree Streets. The campus trees contained a total of 5193 trees of 66 species, of which Catalpa ovata G. Don, Acer mono Maxim., Rhus typhina Nutt, and Salix babylonica L. accounted for 59.7% of the total number. The age structure of the trees in the campus was not ideal, with 71.5% of young trees, 24.0% of maturing trees, 4.5% of mature trees, and only 0.04% of old trees. The trees in the campus provided more energy saving benefits ($60,850, $11.7/tree), carbon reduction benefits ($34,318, $6.6/tree) and aesthetic benefits ($30,150, $5.8/tree). The benefits resulted from air pollutant removal ($12,889, $2.5/tree) and rainwater runoff interception ($15,534, $3.0/tree) were smaller. In addition, tree species with more maturing trees and mature trees (i.e., with larger diameter at breast height) and large leaf area in the campus contributed significantly to ecosystem services. Our results can provide suggestions and certain insights for Chinese campus greening managers in tree species selection and tree management."
Valuing and representing exogeodiversity: From scientific imagery to artistic imagination,Betard,2019,"Geodiversity -i.e., the abiotic equivalent of biodiversity- has gained international recognition and usage for more than two decades in the field of geosciences. It now has the theoretical foundations and practical applications of a new paradigm underlying strategies of geoconservation. However, geodiversity has rarely been considered in the context of extraterrestrial environments despite the great geological and geomorphological diversities of celestial bodies revealed by planetary science missions for at least a mid-century. In this paper, we propose to introduce the term exogeodiversity to encompass the variety of geological, geomorphological, regolith and hydrological features on all extraterrestrial rocky bodies. Like its terrestrial counterpart, exogeodiversity is endowed with a range of societal values, including cultural, historic, artistic, aesthetic, functional, scientific and educational ones. Given the threats associated with the many projects of human exploration of planetary surfaces, an objective assessment of these values is more than ever required. In the absence of direct (in situ) observations with the notable exception of the Moon, the only (indirect) way for a valuation of exogeodiversity is provided by an analysis of the scientific and artistic representations whose historical trajectories are intimately cross-cut. Finally, we stress the potential of the images to promote exogeodiversity in the era of digital technologies, for instance by imagining new forms of virtual exogeotourism."
Ecosystem services from combined natural and engineered water and wastewater treatment systems: Going beyond water quality enhancement,Zawadzka,2019,"Combined natural and engineered water and waste water systems (cNES) are nature-based solutions that utilise naturally occurring processes to remove impurities from water and therefore contribute to the ecosystem service of water quality enhancement. We hypothesise that these systems may also have a potential to deliver ecosystem services other than their primary purpose of water purification and we use spatially-explicit modelling tools to determine these benefits. We focused on three different types of cNES: bank filtration (BF), managed aquifer recharge/soil aquifer treatment (MAR/SAT), and constructed wetlands (CW), and combined the ecosystem services cascade, DESSIN and CICES conceptual frameworks with multiple InVEST 3.4.4 models to investigate the spatial distribution of intermediate ecosystem services within the sites as well as in the surrounding landscape. We also determined the role of habitats present within the sites in wider landscape's connectivity to the nearest Natura 2000 areas using the Circuitscape 4.0 model, assessed the public perception of the aesthetic value of two of the cNES technologies, i.e. CW and MAR/SAT, via an online survey, and linked the determined ecosystem services to their likely beneficiaries. Our results indicated that the sites characterised with semi-natural ecosystems had a good potential for ecosystem services provision and that the selected cNES technologies were favourably received by the public as compared to their engineered equivalents. We concluded that determination of ecosystem services potential from nature-based solutions, such as cNES technologies, should be done in consideration of various contextual factors including the type of habitats/ecosystems present within the proposed solutions, the location within the landscape as well as properties and ecosystem services potential of the areas surrounding the sites, all of which can be facilitated by deployment of spatially-explicit ecosystem service models at early stages of the planning process."
"Determination of Greenway Routes Using Network Analysis in Amasya, Turkey",Kurdoglu,2017,"Open greenways play significant roles for city residents, urban climate, and urban ecosystems. Open green spaces are a combination of systems providing ecological, aesthetic, economic, and recreational benefits. Due to new technologies, rapid increases of population, industrialization, and irregular urbanization, open and green spaces in urban areas are decreasing. Open green spaces in urban areas improve the quality of life of city residents and bring out social and cultural characteristics of a city. In this study, the city of Amasya, Turkey was selected as the study area largely due to its natural, historical, tourist, and traditional values. Amasya is located next to Yesilrmak River and Valley, and it is known for its historical-cultural texture. The purpose of the current study is to design a multifunctional greenway system that will protect the natural, historical, and cultural values of Amasya city, passing through important focal points for the city, and ensuring sustainability by supporting Yeilrmak Valley. In this respect, important focal points were determined for the city. A survey was conducted among 105 people to determine focal points that are important for recreational opportunities, and expectations and preferences of residents of Amasya. Optimum greenway routes were also determined using network analysis in a geographical information system environment with current development plans and greenway planning criteria. Finally, the following routes were identified: (1)Amasya-Erzincan Road Corridor, (2)Yeilrmak River Corridor, and (3)Amasya Castle Corridor. Respective maps were created for these corridors."
LANDSCAPE MODELS OF RECLAMATION AND CONVERSION OF QUARRIES RECOVERING LANDSCAPES,Gasparovic,2009,"The architectural profession has increasingly been taking interest in great transformation spaces of the late 20(th) century, that is, the sites of former industrial and mining regions which have been stripped of their primary function and are in the process of great reconstructions in terms of economy, space and landscape.The landscapes which have throughout history been sacrificed for spaces of production and exploitation are experiencing renewal. The research presented in this paper is related to the topic of landscape recovery and reclamation of quarries, or more precisely, the surface exploitation of stone which potentially has one of the most negative impacts of landscape.In Croatia there are various examples of field exploitation which can be found at inappropriate locations (national parks, nature parks and protected landscapes). There are also a great number of illegal and unplanned sites of stone exploitation, and regardless of the existence of legal obligations there are almost no examples of completed reclamation projects.Recovery of exploited fields could be found in some historical examples - well known 19(th) century European parks (Parc des Buttes Chaumont, Paris; Turkenschanzpark, Vienna). Mid-20(th) century brought new initiative for launching project on landscape rehabilitation (Land-reclamation, Earthworks: Land Reclamation as Sculpture, USA, the 1960s) and the most recent international examples point to a certain trend of new ways of considering post-mining landscapes (IBA: Emscher Park, 1989; Furst-Puckler-Land, 2000).The main goal of the research is to show that contemporary spatial planning of deserted quarries should be exemplary. The past researches in this field have been focused on the methods of technical and biological recovery stressing ecological pollution of the exploited fields as the primary problem. Contemporary examples prove that deserted quarries can be approached also as places with development potential, and not only as barely healable devastated landscape.The research and analysis of the examples led to a systematisation of various spatial relationships which can help in determining basic guidelines for future modelling of post-mining landscapes and imposing new landscape criteria during planning and renewal of already existing mining landscapes in Croatia. Altogether 20 examples of quarries have been analysed. They are contemporary projects created in the last 20 years which have been published in professional literature intended for architects, and four examples from the author's own professional practice which have been to a large degree the enticement for the entire research. The analysis of the examples established basic features of the types of reclamation and conversion which served as criteria of the comparative analysis. They are: the types of exploitation, position of the quarry in the broadest possible context, new planned use, newly added values, intervention types, established relationship with the context. The comparison of the quarries according to the mentioned features gave birth to the models of their reclamation and conversion. The fist model: landscape recultivation - it covers to the highest possible degree the damage of the exploited landscape by applying methods of biological recultivation; the second model: landscape remodelling - establishes and emphasises the relationship between the inherited aesthetic of the exploited Field and the newly planned use; the third model: architectural interpolation: makes use of the spatial potential liberated by exploitation for introducing built structures respecting the peculiarities of the existing site as a context for the architectural concept; the fourth model: land art - artistic interpretations - exposes aesthetic and cultural values of the former quarry by creating large scale art works. The determined choice among these four models does not represent a final framework but an open system which can be supplemented by other models. The suggested classification was a result of the need to establish the fundamental guidelines for choosing various conceptual approaches to reclamation and conversion of quarries.The research has shown that each post-mining landscape is unique and that its recovery necessitates balanced relationship between social, economic and ecological components. Development of such sites entails involvement of various professions, with architectural and artistic as prevailing professions in the analyzed examples. This indicates the fact that their development requires avant-gardism and creativity, and that the process of recovery should be inclined towards innovative solutions and new possibilities.Projects of reclamation and conversion of quarries can add manifold values to space. Ecological values can include soil reclamation, establishment of plant communities and entire ecosystems. Aesthetic values relate to modelling and enhancement of visual components of space which can become a new recognizable landmark. Functional additions enable various new ways of using quarries (stadium, museum, motorway service area, city park, recreational centre, botanic garden, theatre, hotel, opera in the open space, central public facilities), and cultural values are added in the form of new museums, sculpture parks (exhibitions) or theatres. Promotion of values and technologies of historic quarries, and preservation and new uses of industrial heritage emphasize the historic values and create special places of new identity which form a link between the past and future. Future use of deserted quarries can be, among others, seen as a potential encouragement of new development and as a space of special aesthetic and artistic creation. Such spaces can be approached as places of history, with a story that needs to be continued and not hidden. Spaces which have so far been seen as devastations can become unique site of social, cultural and artistic values. At the same time, they represent a particular landscape, architectural space and monumental sculpture."
A simulation-based design framework to iteratively analyze and shape urban landscapes using point cloud modeling,Urech,2022,"The topic of this paper evolves on the discourse of digital modeling in landscape design. Current design methods stagger to address physical forms and dynamics present in the environment. This status quo limits possibilities to integrate scientific evidence when developing spatial and aesthetic configurations in urban landscapes. Remote sensing technology such as laser scanning measures physical forms to reproduce them as geo-specific digital 3D models, while dynamic simulation is widely used to predict how scenarios will perform under given conditions. However, there is still a need for a holistic design process that is capable of integrating both the measured physical forms and physical dynamics. This paper presents a novel framework using point cloud modeling to shape design scenarios that are iteratively evaluated for their performance.The proposed framework is demonstrated through a case study in Singapore. New spatial configurations are tested for the site through an iterative and comparative analysis of the design performance. The case study exposes (1) a site-specific design approach by iteratively modeling a laser-scanned point cloud model, (2) a workflow to convert the geometric data from the point cloud models into voxels and meshes, (3) an integration of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation during design development as per-point attributes, and (4) a comparison of the configurations to identify best performing scenarios.This design framework can support city managers, planners, urban and landscape designers to better inform their decision-making process by relying on accurate scientific feedback. By guiding the design process with the consideration of the built environment as a complex adaptive system, it will be possible to improve how open spaces and ecosystem services perform in cities, and to design landscapes that can mitigate dynamic events such as urban heat islands."
Turning black into green: ecosystem services from treated wastewater,Rozos,2017,"To reduce the impact of urban effluents on the environment, strict regulatory requirements have been set up for the disposal of wastewater, in most parts of the western world, requiring treatment before disposal. At the same time, the urban environment requires water inflows to satisfy a range of urban water demands, and the corresponding water abstractions put pressure on (often scarce) water resources. A suggested synergistic solution is to use the effluents from treatment plants as an alternative resource for irrigation or for industrial uses. Despite the existence of numerous successful applications, this practice is not very common mainly because of increased capital and operational costs, usually exceeding the cost of freshwater. A possible response of the market to this drawback could be to introduce in situ small-scale treatment units to cover local water needs. In this study, we assess the benefits of such a compact wastewater treatment unit that is used to provide water for irrigating an urban green area. Apart from the aesthetic improvement, the evaporative cooling (latent heat), which reduces the air temperature, is expected to have a positive impact on thermal comfort. A pilot scheme was deployed in KEREFYT, the research centre of the Athens Water Supply and Sewerage Company (EYDAP). This scheme was simulated with the urban water cycle model to estimate heat fluxes and the results were fed into Energy2D (a model that simulates heat transfer) to estimate the expected temperature drop. The results are promising and suggest that these technologies could play an important role in a more sustainable, circular water economy."
Restoration of Rice Ecosystem Services: 'Ecological Engineering for Pest Management' Incentives and Practices in the Mekong Delta Region of Vietnam,Horgan,2022,"Ecological engineering is an agroecological approach to pest management that has been adopted by thousands of rice farmers in the Mekong Delta Region of Vietnam. Farmers adopted the intervention as part of a heuristic approach to developing the technology. This study assesses the knowledge, attitudes and practices related to ecological engineering among participating and non-participating farmers. Interviews with 315 farmers revealed a diversity of practices under the umbrella of ecological engineering, all of which were associated with the establishment of linear vegetation strips as habitat for natural enemies. As a restoring service from society to the rice ecosystem, ecological engineering incorporated significant positive-feedback loops, particularly regarding the production of supplementary foods (provisioning services) and the aesthetic value (cultural services) of planted rice bunds. Participating farmers reported fewer insecticide applications to their main rice crop; they applied insecticides at a later crop growth stage (protecting pest regulating services); and they reported higher rice yields. However, a high dependency on government support, the role of agrochemical extensionists in providing information, a tendency to apply pesticides to vegetation strips and little change in the appreciation of wildlife-related services all threaten the social sustainability of the intervention. We recommend greater attention to optimizing linear strips to not only support natural enemies but to also enhance supplementary farm incomes while reducing material and labor costs."
Alternatives for reducing the environmental impact of an ammonia production plant adjacent to a coastal lagoon in the southeastern Gulf of California,Paez-Osuna,2018,"There is an increasing demand for N-fertilizers and the manufacture of N-products worldwide. In Mexico, ammonia production is being promoted by the government, but this development is associated with several environmental impacts. This study examines the causes, effects and mitigation alternatives related to the installation and operation of an ammonia production plant adjacent to a coastal lagoon. A multiplicity of causes (and effects) was identified: water suction (elimination of plankton and larvae), effluent discharge (thermal contamination, salinization, and the effects of chlorine), and the conversion of wetlands (loss of habitat and nursery areas, biodiversity, fishery benefits, retention of contaminants, coastal stabilization, carbon storage and aesthetic value). At present, it is estimated that wetlands (9146 ha mangroves + 22,641 ha others) in the Ohuira-Topolobampo lagoon sustain the production of 3000 t live weight of seafood catches per year, implying that the conversion of 126 ha of wetlands could represent for fishermen a catch reduction of 11.9-41.3 t of shellfish per year and a decrease in the annual retention load of up 0.52 kg Cd, 41.0 kg Cu, 0.40 kg Hg, 280 kg Pb, 88.2 t P and 75.6 t N by wetland sediments. To mitigate the environmental effects associated with the installation and operation of the plant, the following is recommended: (i) afforestation of an equivalent area (126 ha), (ii) installation of an exclusion system for fauna to avoid the incidental capture of plankton and larvae, (iii) the use of cooling towers, and (iv) the selection of an appropriate discharge point for the effluent. A list of fauna and flora of the lagoon, as well as environmental services that could be compromised and affected by the operation of the ammonia production plant, is presented. This study is the first to analyze and document such effects and mitigation options related to land conversion and water management, providing useful information for decision makers.

"People, Property and Territory: Valuation Perspectives and Economic Prospects for the Trazzera Regional Property Reuse in Sicily",Trovato,2023,"As in many parts of Italy and Europe, the Sicilian Trazzera regional property has been for a long time the main land infrastructure supporting the agro-pastoral economy. Throughout its slow evolution, this land heritage has been affected by transport transformations and illegal appropriations by neighboring landowners, which have reduced its potential public function in the current renewed prospects of sustainability and a new balance between territories concerning the issue of the inland areas. A further issue concerns the management of the relationship between private interest and prospects for public reuse in progressively urbanized territorial contexts where this infrastructure takes on considerable economic and real estate interest. The current regional legislation suggests some measures for inter-municipal planning that also include the legitimization of illegal appropriations. From this twofold prospect, according to the wide-spread information and communication technologies (ICTs), and also including the geographic information systems (GIS), this work provides the application of two assessment tools based on a GeoDatabase of the current heard roads in the two areas of quantitative-monetary and aesthetic-qualitative assessment. The first shows the extent to which the fair compensation to be charged for legitimizing land parcels is underestimated today, to the detriment of urban social fixed capital development. The second demonstrates the way that common awareness of landscape value can be nurtured for the benefit of land and ecological-environmental rebalancing."
Spatial Distribution of Urban Vegetation: A Case Study of a Canadian University Campus Using LiDAR-Based Metrics,Gulcin,2021,"Planners and urban managers design green spaces according to established standards, aspiring to create green spaces within and around the built environment. However, when building density is extremely high, it is difficult to design large, accessible green !races. Urban green spaces are even more necessary when built density increases, and it is important to maintain urban vegetation-especially trees-as a major and integral part of tire cities. therefore, examining the distribution of urban vegetation is a tool for policymakers and community groups seeking to simultaneously moderate urban heat-island effects, and mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. The purpose of this study was to compare three different urban vegetation indices in a university campus for quantifying spatial relationships between green and gray infrastructure. Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data were used to assess the distribution of urban vegetation. The indices varied significantly among various buildings according to their use categories (e.g., academic, administrative, etc.). these differences could be used to estimate the provision of ecosystem services for the various use categories and to evaluate trade-offs. For example, higher tree densities should provide greater rates of carbon sequestration and storage, as well as water retention and flood mitigation. Conversely, aesthetic and security considerations might favor lower vegetation density to preserve sight lines and vistas. The tools employed in this study have potential for use at greater scales, including entire cities."
"Measuring Cafe Lovability Using Google's HEART and Understanding the Roles of Usability, Sustainability Innovation, and Innovation Cocreation in Cafe Lovability",Ghory,2023,"This research paper explores and investigates the contemporary, developing, and under-researched concept of product lovability in the UAE cafe industry to introduce a scientific measure for cafe lovability using Google's HEART framework for developing lovable product experiences. Taking a pragmatic view to drawing comparisons between the cafe ecosystem and layout and digital product interface and experience, the research elaborates on mediating roles of product (cafe) usability and innovation (by virtue of innovation cocreation and sustainability innovation) in the existence of cafe lovability. Using a deductive and quantitative approach, a measure of cafe lovability is devised using Google's HEART framework to assess levels of happiness, engagement, adoption, retention, and task success at cafes and validates findings using the brand love scale. Once measurable, cafe lovability is then examined for having possible associations with cafe usability (a measure of experience, aesthetic, and quality) and cafe innovation (a measure of innovation cocreation, sustainability innovation and sustainability knowledge), and we also study the mediating impact of cafe innovation and usability on cafe lovability and brand love. The resulting model for cafe lovability provides the means for measuring cafe lovability and provides grounds for understanding the roles of usability and innovation in this phenomenon. Comparing contemporary cafe experience with a digital product interface in order to produce a lovable coffee experience is a non-conventional approach; like product lovability, the comparison, measurement, and application relies on pragmatic and innovative strategic decision making; it is therefore considered a practical approach due to the onset of digital and creative new-age customers. Further, the concept of product lovability is gaining popularity in practice but remains undiscussed and unexplored in academic research. This study provides grounds for further scientific research-both quantitative and qualitative-to define, test, and apply the measures of lovable products to businesses outside of technology and digital offerings, as well as providing us with the opportunity to study the overlap of product and cafe lovability with sustainability."
Beyond Cleansing: Ecosystem Services Related to Phytoremediation,Guidi Nissim,2023,"Phytotechnologies used for cleaning up urban and suburban polluted soils (i.e., brownfields) have shown some weakness in the excessive extent of the timeframe required for them to be effectively operating. This bottleneck is due to technical constraints, mainly related to both the nature of the pollutant itself (e.g., low bio-availability, high recalcitrance, etc.) and the plant (e.g., low pollution tolerance, low pollutant uptake rates, etc.). Despite the great efforts made in the last few decades to overcome these limitations, the technology is in many cases barely competitive compared with conventional remediation techniques. Here, we propose a new outlook on phytoremediation, where the main goal of decontaminating should be re-evaluated, considering additional ecosystem services (ESs) related to the establishment of a new vegetation cover on the site. The aim of this review is to raise awareness and stress the knowledge gap on the importance of ES associated with this technique, which can make phytoremediation a valuable tool to boost an actual green transition process in planning urban green spaces, thereby offering improved resilience to global climate change and a higher quality of life in cities. This review highlights that the reclamation of urban brownfields through phytoremediation may provide several regulating (i.e., urban hydrology, heat mitigation, noise reduction, biodiversity, and CO2 sequestration), provisional (i.e., bioenergy and added-value chemicals), and cultural (i.e., aesthetic, social cohesion, and health) ESs. Although future research should specifically be addressed to better support these findings, acknowledging ES is crucial for an exhaustive evaluation of phytoremediation as a sustainable and resilient technology."
The Role of Urban Cemeteries in Ecosystem Services and Habitat Protection,Sallay,2023,"Cemeteries, like urban public parks, are an important part of the urban ecosystem, providing semi-natural habitats for many plant and animal species as well as a wide range of ecosystem services: they improve air quality, reduce the urban heat island phenomenon and provide aesthetic and recreational value. This paper explores the role of the cemeteries in the green infrastructure network beyond their sacred and memorial role and their importance as a habitat for urban flora and fauna. In our study, we compared two large public cemeteries of Budapest (Nemzeti Sirkert/National Graveyard and uj Koztemeto/New Public Cemetery) with the Zentralfriedhof Wien (Central Cemetery of Vienna), the latter of which has been forward-looking in terms of green infrastructure development and habitat creation in the past years. Our goal was to determine which maintenance technologies and green space development methods are most beneficial in terms of sustainable habitat creation and the use of appropriate plant species in public cemeteries."
Assessing human perceptions towards large wood in river ecosystems following flooding experiences,Dalu,2022,"Large wood deposited in rivers provides ecological benefits for multiple trophic groups, but public perceptions of these deposits can be varied. In particular, flooding experiences linked to large wood debris could influence how the public and stakeholders view large wood deposited into the river ecosystem. Here, we assessed the perceptions towards large wood using groups of undergraduates, postgraduates and staff from a local university in Limpopo Province of South Africa. A survey was conducted using questionnaires, which were distributed online to a sample of 104 participants across these groups, using both visual (i.e. paired photographs of different river scenarios) and categorical questions. Large shares of respondents regularly used river systems recreationally (62.9%), with woodless systems perceived as being significantly more aesthetic, less dangerous and least in need of improvement. These perceptions, however, differed among university groups, with staff having stronger perceptions of aesthetics (median = 5.5, mean 5.4 +/- 2.8), less dangerousness (median = 3.0, mean 4.2 +/- 3.0) and naturalness (median = 6.0, mean 5.8 +/- 2.6) towards systems with large wood. Correlation analyses indicated significant interrelatedness among perceptions of aesthetics, naturalness, danger and improvement needs. However, negative perceptions towards large wood in the river were generally not determined by any recent experience of flooding in the area, with large wood-related dangers rather associated with leisure activities in rivers by students. These results highlight a need for passing on the knowledge of natural river systems with wood to people in Vhembe Biosphere Reserve and communities' scientists and assessing wider perceptions outside of the university context."
Grotesque transparency and public health communication: the aesthetics and the ethics of ill bodies in the era of digital networks,Nahon-Serfaty,2022,"Background We discuss the aesthetics of grotesque transparency in public health communication campaigns and health-related social marketing initiatives, and its strategic and ethical implications. Methods Some emblematic cases are discussed illustrating the relevance of the grotesque transparency strategy. Results These case studies show aesthetical and emotional considerations that public health scholars and professionals should carefully consider in the context of an expansive visual culture driven by digital communications. They also indicate that with the advent of technologies that expand the capabilities of manipulating and diffusing images the role of the transparently grotesque is more prevalent in public health and social marketing initiatives. Discussion The study of grotesque transparency is particularly important when facing emerging global public health challenges, such as pandemics and climate change-related health issues, in a disruptive communication ecosystem."
Accommodating a tree asset register of street trees in a local government authority setting,Boogaerdt,2022,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to consider how a local government authority may present a tree asset register of street trees for the decision-making of the authority's stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach Using the tenets of population density theory, urban form theory and social stratification theory, the approach of the study is to develop a tree asset register in a local government authority's setting that could be modelled using many different attributes to derive important information for decision-making purposes. Findings Tree asset registers represent a critical tool in managing street trees across local government authorities. Research limitations/implications Although the efficacy of an asset tree register may be curtailed by lack of internal audit or yearly updates, the practical consequence of an asset tree register is that local administrators may use the register to gather summarised, organised and parsimonious measures of a wide range of environmental, historical, cultural, aesthetic and scientific values of street trees. Practical implications Tree asset registers affords ratepayers, developers, tree managers and valuers a technology to plan, coordinate and manage street trees to support ecosystem services. Social implications Asset tree registers offer planners a means to bring about sustainable change management. Originality/value The originality of the study rests in introducing tree registers as a means to meet diverse strategies for street tree management by interested stakeholders."
A Study on the Promotion of Craft Culture Copyright Industry,Lee,2020,"As the 4th industrial revolution is in full swing, major technologies that will lead the 4th industrial revolution such as the Internet of Things (IOT), artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data, and Blockchain are rapidly developing. Throughout the years, many changes in the service platform have begun to be detected.The crafts and culture industry is not being activated due to the decrease in productivity of artisan-centered apprenticeship training and the lack of continuous training of specialists due to the absence of a craft sales platform and marketing manpower. In order to save the shrinking market, search for crafts through the convergence of advanced ICT technologies to improve the productivity of craft products and expand the marketability of the craft culture industry. recommendation.
