Authors,Publication Year,Answer,Analysis
Gissi et al.,2016,yes,"the abstract discusses bioenergy production as an ecosystem service and highlights the environmental concerns associated with it. it emphasizes the need for sustainable feedstock production and the quantification of bioenergy's sustainable potential, which aligns well with research on biotechnological ecosystem service replacement. the study's focus on trade-offs between bioenergy and other ecosystem services, as well as management solutions to mitigate these trade-offs, makes it relevant to the field of ecosystem service replacement research."
Venter et al.,2021,yes,"the abstract discusses the application of spatial multi-criteria decision analysis (mcda) in urban green infrastructure planning, specifically focusing on green roofs in oslo. it highlights the use of cloud computing technologies to enhance public access to ecosystem service assessments, which is directly relevant to biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research. the study emphasizes stakeholder engagement and the identification of ecosystem services such as temperature regulation and stormwater runoff mitigation, which are crucial for understanding and improving urban ecosystems. the findings suggest that the interactive mcda tool can enhance planning efficiency, making it suitable for research in this field."
Vigl et al.,2021,yes,"the abstract discusses the evaluation of cultural ecosystem services (cess) using innovative ai-based methods and social media data, which aligns well with biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research. it highlights the importance of understanding how landscape characteristics contribute to human well-being through cess, and it presents a novel approach to assess these services efficiently. the use of technology to analyze human-nature relationships and support sustainable management is particularly relevant to the field of biotechnology and ecosystem services."
Shortall et al.,2019,yes,"the abstract discusses the complexities of using marginal land for non-food energy crop production in denmark, highlighting the conflicts between agricultural biomass production and environmental objectives. it emphasizes the need for a nuanced understanding of land use that considers ecosystem services, biodiversity, and stakeholder engagement. this aligns well with biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research, as it explores how agricultural practices can be optimized for both energy production and environmental sustainability. the focus on multifunctional benefits and the implications of policy changes further supports its relevance to the field."
Nissim et al.,2021,yes,"the abstract discusses phytoremediation as a sustainable technology for regenerating contaminated brownfields, emphasizing its environmental, social, and economic benefits. it highlights the role of woody plants in urban landscapes and their additional ecosystem services, such as stormwater management, co2 sequestration, and pollution attenuation. the mention of technical constraints and knowledge gaps suggests a need for further research, making the article relevant to biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research by addressing both the applications of phytoremediation and the necessary advancements for its effectiveness."
Rocha et al.,2022,yes,"the abstract discusses the use of ornamental plants in phytoremediation, highlighting their benefits in removing contaminants while also enhancing aesthetic value and providing ecosystem services. this aligns well with biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research, as it explores innovative methods for environmental cleanup and the potential economic benefits of using plants in contaminated areas. the focus on both ecological and health benefits further supports its relevance to the field."
Hilaire et al.,2008,maybe,"the abstract discusses the challenges of water supply and demand in urban areas, focusing on the efficient use of irrigation in residential landscapes to conserve water. while it touches on ecosystem services like carbon regulation and climate control, the primary emphasis is on water management technologies and strategies rather than biotechnological approaches specifically. thus, while it could inform aspects of biotechnological ecosystem service replacement, it does not directly address biotechnology as a central theme."
Correia et al.,2016,maybe,"the abstract discusses public perceptions of biodiversity and how these perceptions can be measured through internet saliency. while it focuses on understanding cultural interest in specific bird species in brazil, it does not directly address biotechnological approaches or ecosystem service replacement. however, the insights on public perceptions and visibility of biodiversity could be relevant for informing conservation strategies that incorporate ecosystem services. further research could bridge the gap between public interest and biotechnological applications in ecosystem service replacement."
Klain et al.,2018,maybe,"the abstract discusses the public's perception of risks and benefits associated with offshore wind farms, particularly focusing on how these perceptions can impact ecosystem services. it highlights the importance of understanding the affective dimensions of development proposals, which is relevant to biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research. however, it does not explicitly address biotechnological methods or applications, making it somewhat tangential to the core focus of that field. the findings could still provide valuable insights into public attitudes towards renewable energy technologies and their ecological impacts, which may be useful in the context of ecosystem service replacement."
Ruoso et al.,2015,maybe,"the abstract discusses the limitations of the ecosystem services (es) concept and emphasizes the importance of incorporating human roles and socio-cultural contexts in understanding es. it also highlights a case study that analyzes the roles of peri-urban farmland, which could be relevant to biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research. however, the focus on social evaluation and stakeholder perspectives may not directly align with the more technical aspects of biotechnological applications in ecosystem service replacement. thus, while it has relevant themes, its applicability may depend on the specific focus of the research in biotechnology."
