74,Self-Organizing Feature Zoning and Multiple Hotspots Identification of Ecosystem Services: How to Promote Ecological Refined Management of Chengdu-Chongqing Urban Agglomeration,Li et al.,2023,yes,"the abstract discusses the integration of ecosystem service (es) stable hotspots into urban planning and refined management, which is directly relevant to biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research. it emphasizes the importance of ecological function zoning and the identification of es hotspots, which can inform sustainable urban development and policy-making. the case study of the chengdu-chongqing urban agglomeration provides empirical data on the temporal and spatial evolution of various ecosystem services, making it a valuable resource for understanding how to balance ecological security with social development."
75,Benefits of selected land management practices on ecosystem services: case studies in four watersheds of Ethiopia,Adimassu et al.,2023,yes,"the abstract discusses the assessment of land management practices, specifically stone and soil bunds, in relation to their benefits for ecosystem services in ethiopia. it highlights improvements in provisioning, supporting, and regulating ecosystem services due to these practices, which aligns well with biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research. the focus on enhancing ecosystem services from degraded lands through specific management strategies is particularly relevant to the field of biotechnology, which often seeks to optimize agricultural practices and environmental sustainability."
76,Tailor-made biochar systems: Interdisciplinary evaluations of ecosystem services and farmer livelihoods in tropical agro-ecosystems,Belle et al.,2022,yes,"the abstract discusses the management of organic matter and its potential to sustain ecosystem services in agricultural settings, particularly in tropical regions. it evaluates the use of organic inputs like compost and biochar while considering both agro-environmental effects and the socio-economic aspects concerning farmers. the findings indicate mixed results regarding soil improvement and highlight the importance of addressing economic disparities among farmers when implementing such technologies. this interdisciplinary approach aligns well with biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research, making it a suitable article for that field."
6,Assessing anthropogenic impacts on riverine ecosystems using nested partial least squares regression,Ferreira et al.,2017,maybe,"the abstract discusses the impacts of various natural and anthropogenic factors on water quality and biodiversity in a watershed context. while it emphasizes the importance of effective management of domestic sewage and identifies key sources of pollution that affect ecosystem integrity, it does not directly address biotechnological solutions or ecosystem service replacement strategies. the focus on statistical modeling and the identification of local factors suggests that while the findings may be relevant to broader discussions in biotechnology and ecological management, the article may not specifically align with research on biotechnological ecosystem service replacements."
11,"Spatial and temporal changes of human disturbances and their effects on landscape patterns in the Jiangsu coastal zone, China",Zhou et al.,2018,maybe,"the abstract discusses the impact of human disturbances on landscape patterns and how these changes are quantified using remote sensing and gis technology. while it focuses on ecosystem management and conservation, it does not explicitly address biotechnological ecosystem service replacement. however, the findings could be relevant for understanding how human activities affect ecosystem services, which could be indirectly applicable to biotechnological solutions in ecosystem management."
18,Coastal flood protection: What perspective in a changing climate? The THESEUS approach,Zanuttigh et al.,2011,maybe,"the abstract discusses coastal management and the challenges posed by climate change, focusing on innovative mitigation and adaptation technologies. while it addresses ecological aspects and the need for healthy habitats, it does not explicitly mention biotechnological approaches or ecosystem service replacement. however, the multidisciplinary framework and emphasis on ecological mitigation measures could align with biotechnological ecosystem service research, depending on the specific methodologies and technologies discussed in the full paper."
31,Trade-Offs and Synergies of Ecosystem Services in Southwestern China,Ran et al.,2020,maybe,"the abstract discusses the evaluation of ecological benefits related to rocky desertification control, focusing on ecosystem services such as soil conservation, water yield, and net primary productivity (npp). while it provides insights into the ecological aspects of ecosystem services, it does not explicitly mention biotechnological methods or interventions that might be relevant for biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research. the findings could inform biotechnology applications indirectly but are not primarily centered on biotechnological approaches."
35,Valuing a managed realignment scheme: What are the drivers of public willingness to pay?,Needham et al.,2019,maybe,"the abstract discusses managed realignment as a flood defense strategy that enhances ecosystem services like carbon sequestration and habitat provision. this aligns with biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research, particularly in the context of flood management and environmental restoration. however, the focus on public perceptions and willingness to pay may not directly address the biotechnological aspects of ecosystem service replacement. thus, while it has relevant themes, it may not fully meet the specific criteria for biotechnological research."
