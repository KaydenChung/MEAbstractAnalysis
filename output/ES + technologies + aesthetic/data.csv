2,Sustainable energy potential from biomass through ecosystem services trade-off analysis: The case of the Province of Rovigo (Northern Italy),Gissi et al.,2016,yes,"the abstract discusses the quantification and mapping of bioenergy's sustainable potential as an ecosystem service, which aligns well with research on biotechnological ecosystem service replacement. it highlights the importance of bioenergy in achieving renewable energy targets while addressing environmental concerns and trade-offs with other ecosystem services. the focus on sustainable feedstock production and management solutions to mitigate trade-offs indicates a relevant application of biotechnological approaches in ecosystem service research."
4,Interactive spatial planning of urban green infrastructure - Retrofitting green roofs where ecosystem services are most needed in Oslo,Venter et al.,2021,yes,"the article discusses the use of spatial multi-criteria decision analysis (mcda) in urban green infrastructure planning, specifically focusing on green roofs in oslo. it highlights the integration of cloud computing technologies to enhance public access to ecosystem service assessments, which is relevant for biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research. the study emphasizes stakeholder engagement and the identification of ecosystem services such as temperature regulation and biodiversity, making it suitable for understanding and improving ecosystem service provision through biotechnological solutions."
6,Harnessing artificial intelligence technology and social media data to support Cultural Ecosystem Service assessments,Vigl et al.,2021,yes,"the abstract discusses the role of cultural ecosystem services (cess) in enhancing human well-being and highlights the challenges in understanding how landscape characteristics contribute to these intangible benefits. it presents a novel ai-based approach that utilizes social media data to assess cess, which aligns well with biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research. the use of technology to evaluate and predict ces patterns can provide valuable insights for sustainable management and adaptive strategies in ecosystems."
9,Reclamation of urban brownfields through phytoremediation: Implications for building sustainable and resilient towns,Nissim et al.,2021,yes,"the abstract discusses phytoremediation, a biotechnological approach to address environmental contamination in urban brownfields. it highlights the multiple benefits of using this green technology, including economic, social, and environmental advantages, which align with the goals of ecosystem service replacement research. the focus on woody plants and their additional ecological functions, such as stormwater management and pollution reduction, supports its relevance to biotechnological ecosystem services. overall, the article appears suitable for research in this area."
10,Phytoremediation by ornamental plants: a beautiful and ecological alternative,Rocha et al.,2022,yes,"the abstract discusses the use of ornamental plants in phytoremediation, highlighting their potential to improve contaminated environments while providing aesthetic and economic benefits. it emphasizes the dual role of these plants in decontamination and enhancing landscape value, which aligns well with biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research. the focus on ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation further supports its relevance to the field."
1,Efficient Water Use in Residential Urban Landscapes,Hilaire et al.,2008,maybe,"the abstract discusses urban water supply challenges and the importance of efficient irrigation practices, which are relevant to ecosystem services. however, it focuses more on water management and conservation strategies rather than on biotechnological solutions or replacements for ecosystem services. thus, while it has some connections to the topic, it may not be entirely suitable for research specifically centered on biotechnological ecosystem service replacement."
3,Familiarity breeds content: assessing bird species popularity with culturomics,Correia et al.,2016,maybe,"the abstract discusses public perceptions of biodiversity and the factors influencing the visibility of certain bird species in brazil. while it emphasizes the importance of understanding public interest in biodiversity for conservation efforts, it does not directly address biotechnological approaches or ecosystem service replacement. however, the insights on public perceptions could be relevant for informing biotechnological strategies aimed at enhancing ecosystem services, particularly in how these services are communicated and valued by the public."
5,"Bird Killer, Industrial Intruder or Clean Energy? Perceiving Risks to Ecosystem Services Due to an Offshore Wind Farm",Klain et al.,2018,maybe,"the abstract discusses the public perception of risks and benefits associated with offshore wind farms, particularly focusing on how these perceptions can impact ecosystem services. it highlights the importance of understanding the affective dimensions of development proposals, which is relevant to biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research. however, it does not explicitly address biotechnological methods or applications, which may limit its direct applicability to that specific field. the insights on public perception and ecosystem services could still provide valuable context for research in biotechnology related to renewable energy."
7,"Reading Ecosystem Services at the Local Scale through a Territorial Approach: the Case of Peri-Urban Agriculture in the Thau Lagoon, Southern France",Ruoso et al.,2015,maybe,"the abstract discusses the limitations of the ecosystem services (es) concept and emphasizes the importance of incorporating human roles and socio-cultural contexts in understanding es. it also highlights a case study that analyzes the interplay of territorial elements in producing es, particularly in food production and aesthetic landscapes. while the focus on socio-cultural aspects and stakeholder engagement is relevant to biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research, the abstract does not explicitly mention biotechnology or its applications. therefore, it may be suitable depending on the specific angle of the research being pursued."
8,Room at the margins for energy-crops? A qualitative analysis of stakeholder views on the use of marginal land for biomass production in Denmark,Shortall et al.,2019,maybe,"the abstract discusses the complexities of using marginal land for non-food energy crop production in denmark, highlighting the conflicts between agricultural biomass production and environmental objectives. it emphasizes the need for a nuanced understanding of land use, which aligns with the themes of ecosystem services and their replacement. however, the focus on denmark's specific policies and land use debates may limit its broader applicability to general biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research. the article could provide valuable insights, but its relevance may depend on the specific context of the research being conducted."
