90,A common framework for sustainability indicators in the wine sector: Dream or reality?,Rugani et al.,2023,yes.,"the abstract discusses the environmental sustainability aspect of the wine sector, which is directly relevant to biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research. the focus on sustainability adoption programs and the lack of indicators for evaluating ecosystem services, as well as the need for a multi-criteria quantitative framework, indicates that the study could contribute to filling gaps in understanding the biotechnological aspects of ecosystem services provided by vineyards and the potential for using innovative solutions to replace or enhance them. the analysis would likely be of interest to researchers working in the field of biotechnology and environmental management within the agri-food industry."
91,"Shadow prices and abatement cost of soil erosion in Shaanxi Province, China: Convex expectile regression approach",Wen et al.,2022,yes.,"the abstract discusses a research paper that examines the sloping land conversion program (slcp) in china, which is a payments for ecosystem services (pes) initiative focused on soil erosion reduction. although the context is primarily related to environmental management, specifically soil erosion alleviation, the evaluation of cost-efficiency, abatement solutions, and the role of external variables in the context of an ecological program could be of relevance to biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research. the findings about the cost-benefit analysis, input/output-side strategies, and the influence of natural conditions align with the broader goal of finding sustainable solutions in the biotechnological realm, even though the focus might not be directly on biotechnology applications."
