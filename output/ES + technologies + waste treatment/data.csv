231,Environmental performance of plastic food packaging: Life cycle assessment extended with costs on marine ecosystem services,Boone et al.,2023,yes.,"the abstract discusses the potential of using alternative biobased biodegradable materials, like phbv, as a more sustainable alternative to fossil-based plastic packaging in the context of food systems, specifically focusing on falafel. it emphasizes the importance of considering not just production but also food preservation and end-of-life fate in evaluating environmental sustainability. the life cycle assessment (lca) is used to compare environmental performance, with a new indicator developed to address the impact of plastic litter on marine ecosystems. although the study currently favors conventional polypropylene packaging in terms of overall impact, the phbv offers a clear advantage in terms of marine ecosystem services due to its lower persistence. this suggests that the research is indeed relevant to biotechnological ecosystem service replacement in the area of packaging, particularly for those interested in developing more sustainable options."
