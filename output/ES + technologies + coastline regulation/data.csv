1,Clustering Urban Multifunctional Landscapes Using the Self-Organizing Feature Map Neural Network Model,Gao et al.,2014,maybe,"the abstract discusses urban multifunctionality and landscape clustering, focusing on various ecosystem services provided by different regions in shenzhen. while it highlights aspects of ecosystem services, such as gas regulation and water supply, the primary focus appears to be on urban planning and regionalization techniques rather than specifically on biotechnological methods for ecosystem service replacement. therefore, its relevance to biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research is uncertain."
