864,The impact of multipurpose dams on the values of nature?s contributions to people under a water-energy-food nexus framing,Foudi et al.,2023,yes.,"the abstract describes a research paper that focuses on the evaluation of ecosystem services in the context of multipurpose dams, specifically within the water-energy-food nexus. although the topic of interest is the tana river basin in kenya and the impacts on nature's contributions to people (ncp), which is a biotechnological aspect of ecosystem services, the focus is more on the soci-ecological interactions and the economic value of these services, rather than purely on biotechnology. the analysis of flood events and their effects on food and feed-based ncp, along with regression analyses, suggests a connection to the biotechnological aspects of maintaining ecosystem balance but is primarily about the management and assessment of ecosystems in a practical setting. therefore, the article would likely be of interest to researchers working on ecosystem service replacement in the broader domain of environmental and resource management, including biotechnological applications that influence or result from such assessments."
871,Studying beef production evolution to plan for ecological intensification of grazing ecosystems,Caram et al.,2023,yes.,"the abstract discusses the challenge of improving beef production in the livestock sector while reducing environmental impacts, specifically focusing on land use, animal performance, and methane emissions in the uruguayan beef production system. the context, objectives, and methods align with the broad area of biotechnological ecosystem service replacement research, as it highlights the potential for ecological intensification of native pastures to increase efficiency and mitigate methane emissions. the significance of the study, which emphasizes the need to shift beef production towards native pastures for both productivity and environmental sustainability, makes it relevant for this field."
